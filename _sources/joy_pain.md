# Motivation


## Discuss

Everyone is to think of two situations in their life:

1. Where there was a difficult task to be done, and you went through a lot of pain while getting the task done.

2. Where there was a difficult task to be done, but you enjoyed getting the task done.

First arrive at 2 such situation from your memory. It is okay if you can think of only one. Then in each case, think what motivated you to work on the task.
