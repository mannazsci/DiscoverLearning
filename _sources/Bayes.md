# Uncertainty and the Bayesian Brain

## Discussion:
What is common about the following sentences:
- Sinduja is always late for parties.
- It usually rains very heavily here in the first week of July.

### Activity/Discussion:
A doctor faced with a patient having a cough (D = Data) has to make a decision about the most likely cause for the symptoms from three hypotheses: a lung cancer (H1), a cold (H2) or gastroenteritis (H3). How would you try and approach this problem?

### Discussion:
1. Are some kinds of biases essential to make decisions? When must we be wary of our biases?
2. The Hindi sentence “Wo doctor hai.” is a gender-neutral way to say “that person is a doctor.” Similarly “Wo nurse hai.” is a gender-neutral way to say “that person is a nurse.” Yet entering these sentences in google translate gives the results shown below. Why might this be the case? Would you say this is acceptable?
